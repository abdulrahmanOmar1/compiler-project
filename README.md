# Compiler Project for MODULA-2 Subset

Welcome to the Compiler Project for a Subset of MODULA-2 programming language! This project aims to develop a compiler capable of translating source code written in the specified subset of MODULA-2 into executable machine code.

## Project Description

This compiler project consists of two main components:

1. **Scanner**: The scanner (or lexical analyzer) is responsible for breaking down the input source code into tokens. It identifies keywords, symbols, literals, and other elements of the programming language based on the provided grammar rules.

2. **Parser**: The parser analyzes the structure of the source code according to the grammar rules of the MODULA-2 subset. It performs syntax analysis and constructs a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the syntactic structure of the program.

## Grammar Rules

The grammar rules define the syntax of the MODULA-2 subset language. These rules specify the structure of module declarations, module headings, blocks, declarations, procedure declarations, statements, expressions, data types, and more.

You can find the grammar rules in detail in the provided grammar definition.

## Implementation

The project includes the following classes:

- **SCANNER.java**: This class implements lexical analysis (or scanning) to tokenize the input source code based on the grammar rules. It identifies keywords, symbols, literals, and other elements of the programming language.

- **Parser (Not Provided)**: The parser component, which is not included in the provided code snippet, performs syntax analysis and constructs the parse tree or AST based on the grammar rules.

## Getting Started

To use the compiler project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the provided Java source code files.
3. Implement the parser component to perform syntax analysis and construct the parse tree or AST.
4. Customize and extend the compiler functionality as needed for your specific use case.
